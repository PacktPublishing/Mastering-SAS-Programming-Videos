This is the code repository for [Mastering SAS Programming[Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
SAS is one of the most popular applications for data analysis and is used widely in enterprises across various sectors such as finance, and healthcare. It holds the highest job market share of all analytics tools available today. If you have a basic SAS programming background and want to get into Data Analysis by mastering SAS and taking your skills to a different level, then this is the right course for you!

This course will help you become proficient in using SAS to handle data, build models, and analyze data so you can gain powerful insights quickly and easily. You will start with a quick refresher of basic SAS and then explore advanced statistical concepts (such as clustering and linear/logistic regression), decision trees, and time series analysis in-depth in SAS. You will also master SAS macros, PROC SQL procedures, and advanced SAS procedures so you can use SQL queries to manage and manipulate your data efficiently.

By the end of this video, you will be an expert in SAS programming and will have taken your skills to the next level. Also, you will be able to handle and manage your data-related problems very easily in SAS and build statistical models.
